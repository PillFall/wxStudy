These folders include code from all the wxWidgets examples. But
commented in a way that I could understand better was going on in the
code.

All the examples was rewritten in a way that must compile in both
Linux and Windows (I do not have a Mac, so I could not test it) using
CMake as the build generator.

Each example has another ReadMe file trying to explain what is the
purpose of the code and app.
